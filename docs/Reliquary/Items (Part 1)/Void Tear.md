# Void Tear

Modes: On (drains item it is set to) / Off

Void Tear is a portable mass storage for a single item/block type. If empty it scans player's inventory when activated for an item/block that's most common in there and sets itself to it. It also immediatelly drains the selected item/block leaving one stack in the inventory. While activated it keeps one stack in the inventory (if it can) whether the player is picking up items/blocks or placing these. When off it will put one stack into players inventory on each right click. It also works with inventories - storing in them when off and taking from them when on, while sneaking it mass stores/takes.
