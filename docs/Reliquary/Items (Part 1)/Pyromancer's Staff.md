Pyromancer's Staff has mutliple modes all related to fire. In Blaze powder and Fire charge mode it shoots blaze and ghast sized fireballs. In Erupt it burns anything in range in front of the player. And Flint and Steel mode works exactly as the vanilla flint and steel. It also destroys any fireballs shot at the player and puts out fires when turned off.
