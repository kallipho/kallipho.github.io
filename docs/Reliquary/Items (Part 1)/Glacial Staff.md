# Glacial Staff

Charged with: snowballs

Modes: On (drains snowballs and freezes water/lava) / Off

Glacial Staff is a ranged weapon that shoots snowballs out of its charge. When turned on it drains these from player's inventory and it also freezes lava (into obsidian) and water (into packed ice) within player's reach so it allows walking on lava and water. These frozen blocks will quickly melt back once outside of the range.
