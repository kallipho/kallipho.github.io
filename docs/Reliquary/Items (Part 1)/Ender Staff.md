# Ender Staff

Charged with: ender pearls

Modes: On (drains ender pearls from players inventory) / Off

Shift-Left click modes: Ender pearl (regular distance) / Ender eye (long distance) / Wraith node (teleport to)
Ender Staff is a teleportation tool. In ender pearl mode it allows throwing ender pearls in the similar way that you would do with just ender pearls in hand. In ender eye mode the ender pearls thrown would go further and faster. In both modes when the ender pearl hits it teleports player in much safer way than vanilla ender pearl. In wraith node mode ender staff teleports player to the wraith node that it is set to (by right clicking with the ender staff on the wraith node).
