# Destruction Catalyst

Charged with: gunpowder

Modes: On (drains gunpowder from players inventory)/Off

Destruction Catalyst causes a small explosion on right click that doesn't affect the player and only destroys mundane blocks (the list of which can be modified in config), leaving all ores and any other more valuable blocks around.
