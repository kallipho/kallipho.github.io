# Emperor's Chalice

Modes: On (can drain water) / Off (can place water)

Emperor's Chalice is both infinite water bucket and empty bucket based on what mode it is in. So you can use it to place or remove water in the world, but it can as well be used with Apothecary Cauldron, Botania's Petal Apothecary and Thaumcraft's Crucible. You can also use it to refill your hunger in exchange for some health.
